# COSMOLOGY-FINAL

My apologies, I'm not very well-versed in GitHub. The packages used are numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, as well as CLASS: the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System.

To execute the code, run bao.py. This will create the plots shown in the plots folder. There is deprecated, non-functional code which runs an anisotropic AP test located in the anisotropic-bao folder.

The project is located at BAO.pdf.
